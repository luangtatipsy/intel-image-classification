# Intel Image Classification Hackathon

This project's objective is to classify images into these 6 following scenes :- buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street. A dataset used in this project is directly download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). According to the Kaggle dataset description, this dataset is originally be published on [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com) Intel Image Classification Challenge. I'm pleased to thank both of them for distributing the dataset.

## Dataset Specification
For this project, I modified the dataset directories a bit for more convenience. The dataset is distributed under `datasets` directory in `root` directory. Inside `datasets` there are 3 directories consisting of `seg_pred`, `seg_test`, and `seg_train` storing unseen images, test images, and training images respectively. Those directories contain 14,034, 3,000 and 7,301 images for training set, test set, and unseen images respectively. All images are sized 150x150.
